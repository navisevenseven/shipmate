# ShipMate — Railway Configuration
#
# Deploy to Railway:
#   1. Connect your GitHub repo
#   2. Set environment variables in Railway dashboard
#   3. Deploy
#
# Required env vars (set in Railway dashboard):
#   GITHUB_TOKEN, GITLAB_TOKEN, JIRA_BASE_URL, JIRA_API_TOKEN, JIRA_USER_EMAIL
#
# All tokens are optional — ShipMate degrades gracefully.
